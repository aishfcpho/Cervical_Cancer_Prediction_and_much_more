# Cervical_Cancer_Prediction_and_much_more
This project aims to predict the onset of diseases affected by demographic and social factors. Diseases that are sometimes ignored only to later surface back with symtoms far more hideous.

The Cervical Cancer Predictor is the one that currently works :D. It has a three layered perceptron and uses data which is contained in the datasets folder. Apart from this, there is a console based app, which can be run by executing the "cervical_cancer_loaded.py".

The main training code is in the file "cervical_cancer_classifier_copy.py". The three png images in the folder show training graphs and results. We achieved an accuracy of ~96% on the test set. We hope to make this into a full scale web application and Android application with a much more comprehensive database of diseases.
